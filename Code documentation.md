### Explaining the code

The project is built around 2 programs, arduino code which handles the different sensors and will run on the arduino.
And a second code written in python which will run on a computer and communicated with the arduino via **[pySerial](https://pyserial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/shortintro.html)**.
For GUI the project uses **[PySimpleGUIl](https://pypi.org/project/PySimpleGUI/)**.
